## Hi there, <a href="#"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25"></a> I'm Dr. Ronish Mugatwala.

Currently, I am Research Fellow at [University of Genoa](https://mida.unige.it/it). I have obtained my PhD through a joint program between the University of Rome "Tor Vergata" and the University of Sheffield.
Over the course of my academic journey, my primary research interests have focused on **coronal mass ejections (CMEs)** and space weather. 

I am passionate about:
- Coronal Mass Ejection morphology and kinematics
- Space weather forecasting and its effects on Earth and technology
- Contributing to open-source scientific tools and space weather datasets

Currently, I am developing a **python wrapper** to get CME and Flare information from various data sources



## üöÄ Research Interests
